# Catering-Workflow-Automation-App
This repository contains the full documentation of an end-to-end Catering Management Solution built using Microsoft Power Apps and SharePoint. The goal of the application is to automate catering event booking, menu exploration, quote calculation, and request submissions, while eliminating scattered manual workflows such as emails, calls, and messages.

## Project Overview

The Catering App streamlines the entire catering request lifecycle by allowing users to browse menus, select items, generate real-time quotes, and submit catering requests in a single digital experience. The system integrates with SharePoint lists for storing menu and request data, supporting real-time menu updates and event management.

## Business Challenges Solved

- Requests arrive through multiple channels (phone, email, website), causing miscommunication and errors.
- Staff spend significant time replying to quote enquiries that may not convert.
- Manual menu details lead to outdated information and claim disputes.
- Repetitive questions from customers increase overhead during peak seasons.

## Key Features

- One-stop catering request submission
- Real-time menu display with pricing and food categories
- Auto-quote generator and order summary
- Shopping-cart style workflow for selection and price calculation
- Auto-population of submitted food selections into the request form
- SharePoint-based storage for catering requests and menu items
- Role-based access control for managers and users
