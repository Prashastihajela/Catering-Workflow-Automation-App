# Technical Documentation

### **PowerDocu Overview**

**PowerDocu** is a free and open-source tool designed for automating documentation of Power Apps and Power Automate flows. The tool is developed by Rene Modery, a Microsoft MVP and a Power Platform enthusiast. It extracts details about your app like App properties, screens, controls, variables, data sources, and flow dependencies, making it easier and faster to document and manage app architecture. PowerDocu is available to download on GitHub.

**How I Used It**

I used PowerDocu to generate a structured documentation for my Catering App, ensuring that all essential app details are well-documented for maintenance, scaling, and transfer knowledge/ document.

**Steps:**

1. Go to https://github.com/modery/PowerDocu > Download the latest version of PowerDocu (https://github.com/modery/PowerDocu/releases/tag/v-2.2.0) from GitHub and unzip the file.
2. Run the PowerDocu.exe file and select the type of documentation to generate (Flow, app, or solution)
3. Export the app from Power Apps and select the .msapp file as the input for generating document.
4. Choose the output format (Word or Markdown) and the output folder.
5. Optionally, select a custom Word template to apply to the output document
6. Click on the Generate button and wait for the documentation to be created

### **Why It Was Helpful**

- Instead of manually documenting my app's architecture, PowerDocu automated the process.
- Helped me maintain a clear, well-organized technical reference for my app.
- Whether for onboarding new developers or handing over the project, the documentation made it easy to understand the app structure.
