# Demonstrating how Power Apps captures menu data and stores it in SharePoint

The video showcases how **Power Apps seamlessly integrates with SharePoint** to capture and store menu data. The process begins with the user navigating the app and exploring the available menu options. Upon selecting an item, the relevant details—such as name, price, and description—**automatically populate the form fields**, eliminating the need for manual entry. Once the user finalizes their selection and fills in any additional details, they submit the form. This submission is then **stored as a record in the SharePoint list**, ensuring that all menu orders are systematically logged and accessible for further processing. This feature enhances **efficiency, accuracy, and user experience** by reducing redundant data entry and streamlining the order management process.
